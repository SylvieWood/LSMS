## DATA

We address the knowledge gap on the linkages between forest cover, agrobiodiversity and dietary diversity through a multi-country assessment across Africa. We explore how forests affect key indicators of peopleâ€™s dietary quality, including a dietary diversity score and the consumption of nutritionally important food groups. We do so by spatially linking household data on food consumption with forest cover and forest configuration metrics.
